## [Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)
- Computers store password as hashes, and those hashes can be cracked by guessing.
- It can be installed with the command `sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget`
- Hashcat needs a word dictionary, you can download rockyou.txt from here [GitHub](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master)  
## [Crack File Password With John](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/)  
- John the ripper is also a password hash cracker, like hashcat  
- John the ripper can be used to crack a password protected file
# A) Installing and testing it out.  
I already had hashcat installed on my system, but you can install it from [this website](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or in kali with the coomand `sudo apt-get install hashcat`  
Before we can try cracking passwords, we first have to choose some test passwords and hash them.  
For this I chose passwords qwerty and ashley, because I know they will be in the rockyou.txt password library.  
I got the hashes with the command `echo -n password  | md5sum`. `-n` parameter is important here, because echo automatically prints out a new line, so the hashed password would be password\n, not the actual password.  
The `-n` parameter has to be after echo, if its after the password, it doesn't work. (I have no idea why, it propably hashes it as well).  
I used the md5 hashing algorythm because it is no longer safe.  
And here are the results.

Now that the hashes have been created, lets crack them.  
The following command is used to crack the password: `hashcat -m 0 hashedpassword library.txt`  
`-m` specifies the hashing type (in this case 0=md5), then comes your password hash and lastly, the password library of your choosing. We will be using the rockyou.txt.  
And boom, qwerty was cracked.

And so was ashley.

# B) Installing John The Ripper  
Okay, this proved to be quite the endeavor.  
I tried installing john the ripper per [these instructions](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/), but I could not get it to work.  
When trying to run ./configure command, i got an error about openSSL header. I could not fix this.  
Then after about 30 minutes of banging my head to a wall and googling I stumbled on to this [guide](https://www.nitttrchd.ac.in/imee/Labmanuals/Password%20Cracking%20of%20Linux%20Operating%20System.pdf), with showed me that john is can be installed by simply giving the command `sudo apt-get install john`  
<img width="476" height="85" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebecddfa-6a5e-41cc-ac4f-1c68937cdfef" />  
After it was installed, I installed the test zipfile from [Tero Karvinen website](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/crack-file-password-with-john/) and gave the command `zip2john tero.zip >tero.zip.hash` to make a new file of it (I dont undertand why it has to be made).  
Then i tried to crack the password with the command `john tero.zip.hash` but I got this error code:  
<img width="197" height="44" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9fee55-1b74-465a-bf95-202c37d874a5" />  
I did not know what to do here so i started googling what could be the issue, but i got nowhere.  
So I did what i should have done first, and that was to try again. I ran the zip2john command again and tried to crack, and this time it was succesful, the password was *butterfly*.  
<img width="391" height="115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea8d3e97-9b2b-4e25-a500-d099f8cf34d0" />  
<img width="301" height="79" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c63245a-50a5-4533-91bb-430b7d9282de" />  
# C) Making a encrypted file and cracking it.  
For this I first made a new directory, and in it i made a text file and wrote some lorem ipsum in it.  
Then i compacted and password protected it with 7zip with the command `7z -p testi` and gave it a password after i was prompted to do so.  
After this things got complicated, i tried to prepare the file for john the ripper with zip2john, but it gave me a error code "Did not find end of central directory"  
But after a bit of googling, i figured that i have to specify 7zip in the prepearing, so `7z2jhon`.  
<img width="453" height="37" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b34d28b-1def-4cb5-a924-3421909a1565" />  
And after that i tried to run john normally on the file.  
<img width="442" height="157" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569b0368-0e55-4291-8e79-43b6a96bde4a" />  
Unfortunately, i was unable to crack 7z encryption with this :(
# D) Making and breaking a hash.  
For this i will be making a password hash with SHA-1 algorythm and breaking it.
At first i will make the hash.  
<img width="175" height="33" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17a8ac53-784a-4d35-a717-99aff564d671" />  
After that i ran hashcat with the given hash.  
<img width="329" height="255" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ff26f21-3dbc-4d69-a4d2-d73aca57f6f9" />  
And the password was cracked. I was unsure about what tool i was supposed to be using in this assignement, so i did it with this as i have gotten quite comfortable with it.
