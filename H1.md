# A) Kali-linux installation on VirtualBox  
To install kali-linux, I first had to download the right image for VirtualBox from the kali.org website (version 2025-2).  
After the installation was complete I unzipped the downloaded file, opened VirtualBox and added the downloaded image to VirtualBox. VirtualBox was installed to my device prior to this assignement.  
Then I started up the new machine. The startup screen asked for a username and password, which I didn't have, but I googled "kali linux default login" and got the default credentials.

# B) Disconnecting the virtual machine from the internet
To disconnect the virtual machine from the web, I navigated to the settings of the machine and disabled the "cable connected" setting.

</br>
To test that the machine was now truly disconnected, I opened terminal and pinged the Google DNS.  
`ping 8.8.8.8`  
The result was as expected.

# C) Port-scanning my own machine
To port-scan my machine, I opened the terminal once again, and typed in the following command  
`nmap -T4 -A localhost`  
(Lähdeviittaus)  
The parameters and their breakdown are as follows:  
`-A` enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and tracerouting (https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html)  
`-T4` parameter defines the scan speed and stealthiness of the scan. The parameter varies from 0-5, 5 being the most agressive scan and 0 the least.  
`localhost` specifies the target, which in this case is my own machine.  
As we can see from the following capture, there weren't any ports open at the moment, because there aren't any services open on the machine that would require open ports.

# D) Installing deamon and re-running portscan  
For the next step I had to install two deamons and see what the results of the portscan would be.  
I chose SSH and apache2. Both of the were already installed on the kali image, so i booted them up with the command `sudo systemctl start ssh/apache2 `  
After both of them were up, I ran the portscan again and got the following results:  
<img width="323" height="251" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81469dc5-40f5-46c9-adc3-0e43df013bd2" />  
As we can see from the results, two ports were opened for the deamons, 22 and 80.  
# E) Adding the metaspoitable 2 image on another machine  
I started by crating a new macine in VirtualBox, and choosing an existing virtual disk, and then chose the on downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable/. After that i started the machine.  
# F) Making a virtual network between the two machines  
After staring both machines, I opened the VirtalBox settings and changed the network adapter for both machines to Host-only and chose the same one for both.  
Then I tested the connection between the machines by pinging metasploitable-machine from my other machine and vice-versa. I got a successful ping from both machines.  
I also tried pinging 8.8.8.8 on both machines and the connection was unreachable.  
# G) Finding metasploitable by portscanning  
Now I will try finding the metasploitable-machine by portscanning. I will use the command `nmap -sn "ipaddress"` (Lähdeviite)  
I did find the metasploitable, but did not find any open ports or services  
<img width="428" height="98" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5648f49c-7029-464a-aad6-47c6381d2774" />  
# F) Portscanning thoroughly and analyzing results.  
In this step I will portscan the metasploitable machine with the command `nmap -A -T4 "ipaddress"`, and got the following results.  
<img width="340" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fd5ebe1-c9cc-4c00-a9e3-347405fafbdf" />  
All of the results did not fit in this screencapture, but there are several open ports.  
The most intresting ports to target for an attacker in this instance would probably be ports 23, 1524 and 21.  
Port 23 is used for telnet connections, and telnet connections are encrypted. Port 1524 is used for something called "Metasploitable root shell" and that sounded intresting. Port 21 is an open tcp port that allows anonymous login, which sounded exploitable. Unfortunately i cannot do a deeper analysis, as my knowledge is still a bit lacking.
