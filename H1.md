# A) Kali-linux installation on VirtualBox  
To install kali-linux, I first had to download the right image for VirtualBox from the kali.org website (version 2025-2).  
After the installation was complete I unzipped the downloaded file, opened VirtualBox and added the downloaded image to VirtualBox. VirtualBox was installed to my device prior to this assignement.  
Then I started up the new machine. The startup screen asked for a username and password, which I didn't have, but I googled "kali linux default login" and got the default credentials.

B) Disconnecting the virtual machine from the internet
To disconnect the virtual machine from the web, I navigated to the settings of the machine and disabled the "cable connected" setting.

To test that the machine was now truly disconnected, I opened terminal and pinged the Google DNS.  
`ping 8.8.8.8`  
The result was as expected.

# Port-scanning my own machine
To port-scan my machine, I opened the terminal once again, and typed in the following command  
`nmap -T4 -A localhost`  
(Lähdeviittaus)  
The parameters and their breakdown are as follows:  
`-A` enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and tracerouting (Lähdeviittaus)  
`-T4` parameter defines the scan speed and stealthiness of the scan. The parameter varies from 0-5, 5 being the most agressive scan and 0 the least.  
`localhost` specifies the target, which in this case is my own machine.  
As we can see from the following capture, there weren't any ports open at the moment, because there aren't any services open on the machine that would require open ports.
