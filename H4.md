# A) Solving dirfuz-1 from [this article](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuzz-urls-find-hidden-directories/)  
I started by downloading the practice target from the website and started it up.  
At first i tried the "commont.txt" word list that can be found from kali linux by default, and I thought that it would work.  
There were a bunch of response codes with the size 154, so i tried to filter those out, but i got 0 matches, so I figured that the word-list did not contain the right words.  
So I tried a few more wordlists, and the second one was a got a hit (directory.list.1.0.txt)

So i tried all of the abowe results on the website.

The two other results look exactly like the startpage, so I dont know why they have a different size.
