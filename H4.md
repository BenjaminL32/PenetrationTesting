# A) Solving dirfuz-1 from [this article](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuzz-urls-find-hidden-directories/)  
I started by downloading the practice target from the website and started it up.  
At first i tried the "commont.txt" word list that can be found from kali linux by default, and I thought that it would work.  
There were a bunch of response codes with the size 154, so i tried to filter those out, but i got 0 matches, so I figured that the word-list did not contain the right words.  
So I tried a few more wordlists, and the second one was a got a hit (directory.list.1.0.txt)

So i tried all of the abowe results on the website.  
<img width="458" height="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5264aa0-2210-4120-91e2-aa1c6338e71e" />  
The two other results look exactly like the startpage, so I dont know why they have a different size.  
# B) Installing FuffMe-practice target ([Installation guide](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuffme-web-fuzzing-target-debian/))  
I followed the article and its instructions but ran in to a few problems. I got an error when running the command `sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 ffufme`  
<img width="583" height="50" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d8c1ea7-c673-4c48-9a89-6e7eb90a8dec" />  
But the error code gave me a clue, I did have apache2 running in localhost so I suspected it caused the discrepancy.  
I shut down apache2 and the got the docker running.  
<img width="526" height="373" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201b872a-e0a0-4754-bcd7-945504757ca2" />  
But if I type "localhost" to the browsed, it still directs me to the apache2 defaultpage, but the ip-address "127.0.0.1" i get the FFUF.ME frontpage.  
I have no idea why this is.  
# C) Basic content discovery.  
This one was quite straightforward, copy-paste the command into terminal and boom, the answer lies before us.  
<img width="380" height="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a7c46f2-1bee-400e-910a-ef14e3d637ed" />  
# D) Content Discovery With Recursion.  
This one follows the same logic as the previous one, but we add a recursion parameter (and deleted /basic from the url) to the command so that ffuf will run the same namefuzzing to directories it finds.  
<img width="388" height="320" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/124163a3-25b2-4801-b25e-9985415723b5" />  
And the search was succesful.  
# E) Content Discovery With File Extensions.  
In this one we will try to find files in a given directory by adding a extension parameter that will add the specified extension to the wordlist.  
<img width="324" height="22" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92c18980-ad81-4848-9c78-8e8e2e776bb5" />  
After running the search, I found the users.log file that the assignement specified.  
## F) No 404 Status.  
This one is a bit similar to the dirfuz-1 challenge in A). The page returns every word with the 200 reponse code, but most of them are "page not found" sites, so we want to filter those out. In this assignement we do it by size filtration, but this can be done with other parameters as well.  
First I ran it without filtering just to test.  
<img width="433" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffd9cbba-9991-48e4-8b85-081189939cac" />  
By the amount of responses I guess that every single word tried returned a 200 response code. So lets try to filter out by size count, in this instance, almost all of the responses have size of 669.  
<img width="386" height="239" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a36bde2-86eb-46ec-93b0-04a6ff15cd85" />  
And the secret was found.  
# G) Param Mining
The directory cd/param has a missing parameter, and returns a 400 error code, so we will try to fuzz out the missing parameter (so we will fuzz after the question mark).  
<img width="380" height="236" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c2a33a9-eb8a-456a-911d-7091828f6957" />  
And we found that the missing parameter was "debug".  
# H) Rate Limited
In this assignement the target page has a limit on how many responses it will accept.  So we will use `-p 0.1` parameter to limit the amount of requests to one per 0.1 seconds and `-t 5` to make 5 instances of ffuf so each instance will send 10 request per second totaling to 50 per second (We know that the limit is 50)  
<img width="389" height="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0ebd7f9-c906-441a-bc51-4bcf03c0b9ce" />  
And we found the "flag" oracle.  
## I) Subdomains - Virtual Host Enumeration.  
In this assignement we will try to find subdomains by fuzzing out the host data (Im not quite sure how this works.)  
I guess we are trying to find different hosts for the ffuf.me domain?  
But anyways, first we will try to fuzz the host using the subdomains.txt wordlist and the parameter FUFF.fuff.me.  
<img width="362" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b17f892-cbff-4afe-aaad-c81da9bc4a5a" />  
Once again there is quite a bit of hits so lets try to filter out by size 1495.  
<img width="333" height="211" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca314b8-c32a-462d-9dc4-d3a6cd421a9b" />  
And we got the answer we were looking for, redhat.
