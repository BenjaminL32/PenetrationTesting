# A) Solving dirfuz-1 from [this article](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuzz-urls-find-hidden-directories/)  
I started by downloading the practice target from the website and started it up.  
At first i tried the "commont.txt" word list that can be found from kali linux by default, and I thought that it would work.  
There were a bunch of response codes with the size 154, so i tried to filter those out, but i got 0 matches, so I figured that the word-list did not contain the right words.  
So I tried a few more wordlists, and the second one was a got a hit (directory.list.1.0.txt)

So i tried all of the abowe results on the website.

The two other results look exactly like the startpage, so I dont know why they have a different size.  
## B) Installing FuffMe-practice target ([Installation guide](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/fuffme-web-fuzzing-target-debian/))  
I followed the article and its instructions but ran in to a few problems. I got an error when running the command `sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 ffufme`

But the error code gave me a clue, I did have apache2 running in localhost so I suspected it caused the discrepancy.  
I shut down apache2 and the got the docker running.

But if I type "localhost" to the browsed, it still directs me to the apache2 defaultpage, but the ip-address "127.0.0.1" i get the FFUF.ME frontpage.  
I have no idea why this is.  
## C) Basic content discovery.  
This one was quite straightforward, copy-paste the command into terminal and boom, the answer lies before us.

## D) Content Discovery With Recursion.  
This one follows the same logic as the previous one, but we add a recursion parameter (and deleted /basic from the url) to the command so that ffuf will run the same namefuzzing to directories it finds.

And the search was succesful.
