# X) Summary of references  
## [A01:2021 – Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)
- Broken access controls are currently at the top of OWASPs vulenerability list  
- Common access control vulnerabilities are URL modifications and inproper privilige configurations  
- You can try to mitigate this by denying everything but public resources from users and disabling web-server directory listings
## PortSwigger Academy - [Insecure direct object references (IDOR)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/access-control/idor)  
- IDOR means Insecure Direct Obejct reference
- IDOR is a vulnerability when applications use user supplied inputs directly without sanitization
- This vulnerability could be exploited by manipulating URLs to return results the users should not have access to
## PortSwigger Academy - [Path traversal](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-path-traversal)
- Path traversal vulrnerability allows user to modify the request for data
- This vulnerability allows the user to modify the request in such a way that the web server will return any specified file in the system
- To mitigate this, you can whitlist allowed outputs of the system, or restrict the allowed values user can input
## PortSwigger Academy - [Cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting)  
- Cross-site scripting is a vulnerability that might be exploited to gain access to user data and privilege in the context of the website.
- There are 3 types of cross scrpiting attacks. Reflected, stored and DOM-based XSS attacks
- I think this vulerability requires user to click the modified URL.
# A) Totally legitimate cerificate  
In this assignement I downloaded ZAP-proxy, generated a certificate and added to Firefoxes list of certificates.  
At first I navigated to zaprozy.org/download website and downloaded the "Cross Platform Package"  
I tried to download it from kali packet repository, but my kali virtual machine is a bit bricked so i can´t update the OS :)  
After that I opened it by running the .sh file from the package and it was installed succesfully

Now that zaproxy was open, I navigated to settings and search for "certificate" and generated a new server certificate.

I added this new certificate to my browser.

A this point i realized that showing a working zaproxy required me to download apache2 or the portswigger lab. And because i had bricked the entire OS, I had to make a new virtual machine and try again.  
</br>  
But now virtual box would not even open a new image. I tried to switch to my deabian VM but i could not update that neither.  It seems that the entire virtual box is bricked, so I installed the latest version.  
After a while of banging my head to a wall, I finally got the kali image working ( I tried to unzip the downloaded file normally, and it required 7zip, and I was a bit tired when trying to do this xD)  
So, after I got the new machine running, I repeated the steps above
