# A) Prepearing for Capture-The-Flag  
- I have a intel processor, which has amd64 processor architechture.
- The virtual network cable can be yanked at any time.
- I have a completely new kali linux image set up, so any sensitive information is not on it.
- I only use tools built in to Kali Linux or in the packet manager.
- No notes on the computer
- No local AI
# B) HTB Dancing  
I made an account on the HackTheBox website, conneted to it using openvpn per the websites instructions, and spawned a machine from the "Dancing" category.  
When the machine was up, i portscanned it with the command `nmap -A -T4 -p 1-65355 ip-address`  
Then i started finding the correct answers for the questions in hack the box ( im not explaining each step here)  
The final step had us connecting to smb workgroup that had no password protection, and the downloading flag.txt from the files.  
(Do to extreme time constraints, the report for this is quite short)
