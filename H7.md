# A) Prepearing for Capture-The-Flag  
- I have a intel processor, which has amd64 processor architechture.
- The virtual network cable can be yanked at any time.
- I have a completely new kali linux image set up, so any sensitive information is not on it.
- I only use tools built in to Kali Linux or in the packet manager.
- No notes on the computer
- No local AI
# B) HTB Dancing  
I made an account on the HackTheBox website, conneted to it using openvpn per the websites instructions, and spawned a machine from the "Dancing" category.  
When the machine was up, i portscanned it with the command `nmap -A -T4 -p 1-65355 ip-address`  
Then i started finding the correct answers for the questions in hack the box ( im not expalining each step here)  
The final step had us connecting to smb workgroup that had no password protection, and the downloading flag.txt from the files.
